# VOCABULARY

        rdfs:comment "The Dataset Quality Vocabulary (daQ) is a lightweight, extensible core vocabulary for attaching the result of quality benchmarking of a linked open dataset (usually an expensive process) to that dataset.  daQ is designed to be extended by custom quality metrics.  Use cases include filtering and ranking datasets by quality." ;

A category groups a number of dimensions relevant to each other which aims at measuring the quality of a dataset from different aspects.

daq:Dimension

	rdfs:comment	"Each dimension is part of a larger group called category (See daq:Category). Each dimension has a number of metrics which are associated to it. A dimension is linked with a category using the daq:hasDimension property. Dimensions are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage." ;

daq:Metric
	a	rdfs:Class, owl:Class ;
	rdfs:comment	"The smallest unit of measuring a quality dimension is a metric. Each metric have a value which is associated to the quality computed. Since this value is multi-typed (i.e. one metric might return true/false whilst another might require a double value), then the value's (daq:hasValue) range is inherited by the metric's attributes. A metric might also require additional information (e.g. a gold standard dataset to compare with). Therefore, a concrete metric representation shall also define such properties (see daq:requires). Metrics are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage." ;
